# extern-generator

> **Experimental.** A work in progress, made to find out what the declarations should look like. Expect the output, the rules behind it and the tool itself to change.

Generates Haxe extern declarations of the Apple SDKs' Objective-C and C APIs (macOS, iOS and Mac Catalyst) for [hxmc](https://github.com/benmerckx/hxmc)'s Objective-C interop, from clang's AST of the SDKs' headers, and splits them into the libraries below.

The generator is plain Haxe and builds with hxmc.

## Libraries

An app depends on its platform's library, which brings the shared ones:

| platform | library | with |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | [apple-appkit](https://github.com/hx-objc/apple-appkit) | [apple-shared](https://github.com/hx-objc/apple-shared), [apple-shared-mac](https://github.com/hx-objc/apple-shared-mac) |
| iOS | [apple-uikit](https://github.com/hx-objc/apple-uikit) | apple-shared, [apple-shared-uikit](https://github.com/hx-objc/apple-shared-uikit) |
| Mac Catalyst | [apple-catalyst](https://github.com/hx-objc/apple-catalyst) | apple-shared, apple-shared-uikit, apple-shared-mac |

Optional: [apple-matter](https://github.com/hx-objc/apple-matter) (Matter, the SDKs' largest framework, on every platform) and [apple-appkit-legacy](https://github.com/hx-objc/apple-appkit-legacy) (macOS's frameworks gone in all but name, OpenGL, QuickDraw, Tcl, Ruby, ..., and the classes deprecated as a whole that nothing else names).

Each module is in the library of the platforms where its text is the same (`objc-extern-gen slice`, src/Slice.hx), so a platform's libraries have each type once, and together are the platform's whole output. They refer to each other's types by their paths, without declaring a dependency where they cannot (a shared library on a platform's): a library used without the ones it refers to fails where such a type is used, not before.

## Use

macOS with Xcode (clang, the macOS and iOS SDKs) and node:

```sh
npm install
npm run gen                   # builds bin/objc-extern-gen, writes out/ (a few frameworks)
tools/libs.sh out/sdk         # the three platforms, the whole SDKs, and the libraries in out/sdk/libs
tools/publish.sh out/sdk/libs # pushes the libraries to their repositories
```

`bin/objc-extern-gen <out-dir> [--frameworks all|Foundation,AppKit,...] [--platform macos|ios|maccatalyst] [--check]` writes a package per framework (`appkit.NSView`, `foundation.NSString`, ...), one module per class or protocol, `skipped.txt` (what was left out and why) and, with `--check`, `ObjcExternsCheck.hx`, a program naming every type. `--frameworks all` is the whole SDK: every framework with an umbrella header that imports on its own and that the platform links (its `.tbd` names the platform: Mac Catalyst links 55 fewer than macOS), `Kerberos` aside (it redefines `GSS`'s types), `CoreHaptics` and `NetworkExtension` imported first (else `AVFAudio`'s `AVAudioSession` and `AccessorySetupKit`'s `ASAccessory` are unavailable to them), AppKit not on Mac Catalyst. A framework inside another (`HIServices`, the Accessibility API, in `ApplicationServices`) is read through its outer framework's header. One in `/System/Library/SubFrameworks` that an umbrella re-exports is the umbrella's (iOS's `ARKitCore`, `ARKitUI` and `ARKitFoundation`: `arkit`, linked as `ARKit`, as on Mac Catalyst, whose ARKit has them itself); another is in scope by its own name. `dispatch`, `os` and `xpc` name libSystem's libraries (GCD, os_log's and os_unfair_lock's functions, XPC). `--platform ios` reads the iOS SDK (arm64) and iOS's availability; `--platform maccatalyst` the macOS SDK with its iOS frameworks (`/System/iOSSupport`) and Mac Catalyst's availability (clang infers it from iOS's), a framework there named as on iOS (hxmc's linker finds its Catalyst build). The dump is read one top-level declaration at a time (an SDK's is gigabytes). `--json` and `--text` read existing dumps instead of running clang; `--keep-dumps` keeps the ones it makes (in `<out-dir>/.clang`).

`bin/objc-extern-gen slice <out-dir> <macos-dir> <ios-dir> <maccatalyst-dir>` writes the libraries, each a haxelib (`haxelib.json`, `src/`).

The generated declarations are derived from Apple's headers: they are not part of this repository, and they carry none of the headers' comments.

## Rules

What the declarations make of the headers (decided in [#1](https://github.com/hx-objc/extern-generator/issues/1)):

- **Properties** are `var x(get, set)`. One readonly in a class and readwrite in a subclass (`NSPanel.floatingPanel`) gets only its setter in the subclass (`panel.set_floatingPanel(true)`): Haxe does not let a subclass redefine the variable, and a setter on the superclass would accept calls that fail at run time.
- **Informal protocols**, categories of `NSObject` that name methods for other objects to implement (`controlTextDidChange:`, `validateMenuItem:`), are left out (`skipped.txt` lists them): those outside NSObject's own headers that a formal protocol of their name supersedes, or whose methods all take their sender first (named `sender`, a notification, or an object of the class the selector's first piece names).
- **Names**: enum constants lose their common prefix (`NSWindowStyleMask.Titled`); types are non-null unless `_Nullable`. Methods whose selectors begin alike are `overload`s of the first piece where their parameters' types differ (`systemFontOfSize(size)`, `systemFontOfSize(size, weight)`), the others named by their pieces joined. `@:deprecated` carries no message. A type's name starts upper case (`gssapi.h`'s constants are `GssapiConstants`, vImage's `vImageConverterRef` `VImageConverter`); of two in a package whose names differ only in case (Matter's `MTRBaseClusterOTASoftwareUpdateProvider` and its deprecated `...Ota...`), one file where file names ignore case, the deprecated one goes and references to it name the other.
- **Protocols** are extern interfaces (`@:hxmc.objc("Name")`, extending the protocols they adopt), named `NameProtocol` when a class has the name (`NSObjectProtocol`). Optional members are `@:optional`: a Haxe class implementing the protocol may leave them out, and Objective-C then sees no such method. A protocol's methods are never overloads (a Haxe class implementing one declares none): a method keeps its selector's first piece when no other method of the protocol's family begins with it (or it is that piece alone), else its pieces are joined (`parserFoundCharacters` for `parser:foundCharacters:`). `id<P>` is `P`. A class implements the protocols it adopts, under the protocols' names (a method the class names otherwise gets a field of the protocol's name too, sending the same selector); one whose names the class gives other members is left out (`skipped.txt`). Which methods are `@optional` is read from the protocol's header, which clang's dumps do not tell. A protocol's class members (`+supportsSecureCoding`, `+readableTypesForPasteboard:`) are statics of its interface, which Haxe allows in extern interfaces: a Haxe class conforming implements them as its own statics (hxmc registers those on its metaclass).
- **Lightweight generics** are type parameters bound to `hxmc.objc.Id` (any object, which the root classes and protocols extend) and defaulting to it: `NSArray<ObjectType:Id = Id>`, `NSArray<NSString *> *` is `NSArray<NSString>`, a bare `NSArray *` `NSArray<Id>`. A superclass's arguments are read from the declaration (`NSLayoutXAxisAnchor extends NSLayoutAnchor<NSLayoutXAxisAnchor>`). A static method declares the class's parameters it uses (`alloc<ObjectType:Id>()`). Haxe's parameters are invariant: a covariant class (the immutable collections) has `upcast`, widening its elements to a supertype (`NSArray.upcast(subviews):NSArray<NSObject>`).
- **Options** (`NS_OPTIONS`) are enum abstracts with `|` and `&`, `None` (no bits) and `has` (all the given bits set: `o.has(WithoutChanges)`).
- **Haxe values where Cocoa takes `NSString` or `NSNumber`**: a parameter or property of either type is `foundation.NSStringArg` or `NSNumberArg`, an abstract over it (`@:forward`, from and to it) that converts a Haxe `String` (an autoreleased copy), or an `Int`, `Float` or `Bool`, by `@:from`: `field.placeholderString = "Search"`, `formatter.multiplier = 100`. Results stay `NSString` and `NSNumber`. Properties are typed as their setters take them, as Haxe allows a property one type; protocols alike, as the classes implementing them must match. Collections are not converted.
- **Constants of the headers** (`static const NSInteger NSNotFound = NSIntegerMax;`, `NSControlStateValueOn`): as constant macros, their initializers evaluated.
- **Constant macros** (`#define kVK_Space 0x31`, `#define kAXTitleAttribute CFSTR("AXTitle")`, `((CGWindowLevel)20)`, expressions of other constants) are constants of their header's constants class, with the anonymous enums' (`hitoolbox.EventsConstants.kVK_Space`): `Int`, `hxmc.I64` or `Float`, and an `NSString` for `CFSTR` and `@"..."`, made when first used. A macro of anything else (attributes, calls, C strings) is left out (`skipped.txt`). The preprocessor's output is read (`clang -E -dD`), its line markers telling each macro's header.
- **Function pointers** are `Ptr`: a `@:hxmc.callback` function's address (`hxmc.unsafe.Callback.addr`) goes there.
- **Packages**: one per framework; Core Graphics' types (`CGRect`, `CGPoint`, `CGSize`, ...) are in `coregraphics`.
- **Types**: `id` is `hxmc.objc.Id` (any object: messages to it need a cast or `Std.downcast` first), `id<P>` `P`, `Class` `hxmc.objc.ObjCClass` (a class object: `ObjCClass.of(C)`). Core Foundation's `Boolean` is `Bool`. `const char *` is `hxmc.unsafe.CString`, other pointers `Ptr`. A block is a Haxe function (`completionHandler:(Null<NSData>, Null<NSURLResponse>, Null<NSError>) -> Void`), a block taking or returning blocks too (`performAsynchronousFileAccessUsingBlock(block:(() -> Void) -> Void)`), `Null<...>` when `_Nullable`.
- **Objects of C** (Core Foundation's types and those built like them: `CGColorRef`, `CGPathRef`): an extern class implementing `hxmc.objc.Id`, named after its `…Ref` typedef, for each struct the headers bridge to Objective-C (`CF_BRIDGED_TYPE`); a non-`const` typedef of a `const` one's struct is its subclass (`CGMutablePath extends CGPath`). A struct bridged toll-free to a class is that class (`CFStringRef` is `NSString`, `CTFontRef` `NSFont`, `CFMutableArrayRef` `NSMutableArray`); `CFTypeRef` is `Id`.
- **C functions and variables** of the frameworks in scope are static fields of one class per framework, under their C names (`coregraphics.CoreGraphics.CGColorCreate`, `appkit.AppKit.NSFontAttributeName`): `using coregraphics.CoreGraphics;` makes them methods of their first argument (`ctx.CGContextFillRect(r)`). A function returning an object the caller owns is `@:hxmc.retained`: C's object by Core Foundation's Create rule (`Create` or `Copy` in its name, in a region the headers audit) or `CF_RETURNS_RETAINED`, an Objective-C object by `NS_RETURNS_RETAINED` only (ARC's rule); a function returning C's object outside an audited region is left out. Left out too: functions only in their headers (`static inline`: `CGRectMake`, no symbol), reference counting (`CFRetain`, `CGColorRelease`: the compiler's) and variadic ones. A block a C function takes or returns is `hxmc.objc.Block<F>` (converted from and to a function `F` where it is passed: `path.CGPathApplyWithBlock(e -> ...)`). A variable `const` at its top level, or holding an object, is `final`.
- **Variadic methods**: a nil-terminated list of objects (`NS_REQUIRES_NIL_TERMINATION`: `arrayWithObjects:`, `dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:`) is its named parameters and `...rest` of the first one's type, `@:hxmc.nilTerminated` (`NSArray.arrayWithObjects(a, b, c)`; an overload beside `arrayWithObjects:count:`). Format methods (`stringWithFormat:`, `predicateWithFormat:`) and mixed lists are left out: format in Haxe, or use the non-variadic sibling (`predicateWithFormat:argumentArray:`).
- **Redeclarations**: a class redeclares `alloc` and the initializers it inherits for their result's type; not `self`, `new` or `allocWithZone:`. `retain`, `release` and `autorelease` are left out (memory is the compiler's).
